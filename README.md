# AtliQ Mart 

In the southern part of India, Atliq Mart is a retail chain that operates more than 50 supermarkets. A significant promotion was held at all 50 of their stores during Sankranthi 2024 and Diwali 2023. 
The challenge was to empower the management with valuable insights using MySQL, PowerBI, and Canva.


I'm Devendra, and I recently completed a project. I finished the project by using a range of tools and strategies while adhering to the Codebasics Mysql and PowerBI Course. I used MySQL, learning about Joins, CTEs, Subqueries, and other topics. Data visualization was aided by PowerBI, while presentation creativity was enhanced using Canva.
